## Shiny App

This app is used to classify the different iris species by the width/length of the petal or sepal of an iris flower.
This app used a decision tree to classify the iris species. Then uses the input values from the sliders to predict the iris species.

There are four tabs in the app.
### Tab 1:
Shows the input values from the sliders and the predicted iris species

### Tab 2:
Shows the classification tree, with the path of classified species colored in purple.

### Tab 3:
Shows the boxplots of the flower measurements categorized by iris species. The classified species colored in purple

### Tab 4:
Shows the summary of the flower measurement of the classified iris species.
